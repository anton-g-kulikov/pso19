# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Jekyll-based static website for the Public Search and Rescue Team of the Republic of Khakassia (ОБЩЕСТВЕННЫЙ ПОИСКОВО-СПАСАТЕЛЬНЫЙ ОТРЯД РЕСПУБЛИКИ ХАКАСИЯ). The site is built with Jekyll and styled using Tailwind CSS with custom typography settings.

## Development Commands

### Setup and Installation
```bash
# Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Install Node.js dependencies  
npm install
```

### CSS Building and Development
```bash
# Build CSS once
npm run build:css

# Watch CSS changes during development
npm run watch:css

# Start Jekyll development server
npm run start
# or
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Run both CSS watch and Jekyll server concurrently
npm run dev
```

### Site Access
- Local development: http://localhost:4000

## Architecture and Structure

### Layout System
- **Default Layout** (`_layouts/default.html`): Base template with header, navigation, main content area, and footer
- **Specialized Layouts**: `about.html`, `contact.html`, `gallery.html`, `page.html` for different page types
- **Includes**: Modular components in `_includes/` (header, footer, navigation)

### Content Organization
- **Pages**: Static content in `_pages/` directory (about.md, contact.md, events.md, gallery.md, guide.md)
- **Homepage**: `index.md` in root directory
- **Assets**: Images, CSS, and documents in `assets/` directory

### Styling Architecture
- **Source CSS**: `assets/css/main.css` contains Tailwind directives and custom styles
- **Compiled CSS**: `assets/css/styles.css` (generated by Tailwind CLI)
- **Tailwind Config**: Custom color scheme, typography settings, and font family (Rubik)
- **PostCSS**: Handles Tailwind processing with autoprefixer

### Key Design Elements
- **Color Scheme**: 
  - Primary: `#4a5568` (blue), `#F0801C` (orange)
  - Accent: `#68d391` (green), `#89BE41` (header green)
- **Typography**: Rubik font family throughout
- **Components**: Reusable CSS classes for buttons, guide sections, gallery items, warning boxes

### Content Language
- Site content is in Russian
- Uses Cyrillic characters in titles and content
- Language attribute set to "ru" in HTML

### Key Features
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Typography plugin for markdown content styling
- Image gallery with hover effects
- Document downloads (PDF guides)
- Contact information and donation QR codes

## File Structure Notes
- Jekyll excludes `node_modules`, `package.json`, `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js` from site build
- `_site/` contains generated static files (not tracked in git)
- Uses permalink: pretty for clean URLs

## Development Workflow
1. Content changes: Edit markdown files in `_pages/` or root `index.md`
2. Style changes: Modify `assets/css/main.css` and run `npm run build:css`
3. Layout changes: Edit files in `_layouts/` or `_includes/`
4. For active development: Use `npm run dev` to watch CSS and serve Jekyll simultaneously
